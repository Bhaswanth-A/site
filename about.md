## About Automation and Robotics Club, BPHC 

The Automation and Robotics Club (ARC) is a student organization at BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus.  We comprise people who love experimenting around with circuit boards, codes and yes, ideas. ARC was started in 20__ and has been around for quite some time now.
Robotics is a versatile field which is highly interdisciplinary. Even small projects involve coding, mechanical, electronics and design expertise, which means we always work in teams and all our projects are group projects.
Our current projects include autonomous applications like chess-playing using AI, autonomous drawing robot and fields like self-navigation and self-balancing.
Also, we proudly boast of a full scale robotic arm and a micro-quadcopter developed on our own from scratch.
