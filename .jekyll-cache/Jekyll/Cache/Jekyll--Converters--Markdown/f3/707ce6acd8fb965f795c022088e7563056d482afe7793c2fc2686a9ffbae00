<p>Hi, congratulations on making it to the 2nd day of the workshop. You will be learning how to talk to your Arduino and interface it with other sensors to make it smarter.</p>

<h3 id="the-sketch">The Sketch</h3>
<p>Every individual program that is written for the Arduino is called as a ‚Äú<strong>sketch</strong>‚Äù, the most basic of all the sketches is the ‚Äú<strong>blank sketch</strong>‚Äù its the first sketch you see when you open a new IDE page. Which kinda looks like this</p>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Go ahead and open your IDE, open a new sketch in case you have some other sketch pre-loaded.</p>

<p>Every <em>(mostly)</em> arduino sketch has two components and they are the <strong><a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/structure/sketch/setup/">void setup()</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/structure/sketch/loop/">void loop()</a></strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>void setup()</strong> <br />
The setup() function is called when a sketch starts. Use it to initialise variables, pin modes, start using libraries, etc. The setup() function will only run once, after each power up or reset of the Arduino board.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In layman terms, the <strong>setup()</strong> part of the sketch contains code that needs to be only run once.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>void loop()</strong><br />
After creating a setup() function, which initialises and sets the initial values, the loop() function does precisely what its name suggests, and loops consecutively, allowing your program to change and respond. Use it to actively control the Arduino board.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In layman terms, the <strong>loop()</strong> part of the sketch contains code that is to be run indefinitely.</p>

<p>Now that you understand the basic layout of a sketch, lets start learning how to code.</p>

<h2 id="inputoutput">Input/Output</h2>

<p>Like the laptop/desktop through which your currently reading this walk-through can be connected to external devices like keyboards, mouse, printers, joysticks. The Arduino which is a microcontroller can also be connected to external input/output devices (input devices are usually called sensors) and just like devices for your laptop most of these sensors can be classified into two categories.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Input</li>
  <li>Output</li>
</ol>

<p>The names are self-explanatory but lets go through a few examples for better understanding.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Category</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Laptop</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Arduino Uno</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Input</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Mouse, Keyboard, Joystick</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Push Button, Keypad, IR Sensor, Temp Sensor, LDR</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Output</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Monitor, Printer</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Motors, LED, LCD Display</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Just like your laptop has USB, HDMI and microUSB ports that can be used to connect external devices, the Arduino has a set of pins called the <strong>GPIOs (General Purpose Input/Output pins)</strong> that can be used to connect external devices to the Uno.</p>

<h3 id="pinmode">pinMode()</h3>
<p>Now that you know what kinda external devices you will be working with its high time you also learn how to let your arduino know what device it is about to work with using <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference.PinMode">pinMode()</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>pinMode()</strong><br />
Configures the specified pin to behave either as an input or an output. See the description of digital pins for details on the functionality of the pins.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since the nature of a device (input/output) and the pin its connected to, doesn‚Äôt change mid-program, its often sufficient to let the Arduino know about the devices its dealing with once at the start of the sketch, hence <strong>pinMode()</strong> is placed inside the <strong>void setup()</strong> and not inside the <strong>void loop()</strong>.</p>

<p>The pin numbers for the Arduino board are mentioned on the board and can be used as it is inside the <strong>pinMode()</strong> function.</p>

<h2 id="talking-digital">Talking Digital</h2>
<p>Now that the Arduino has an heads up about the kind of device its dealing with its time we start talking with these devices.</p>

<p>Most of these devices while they can be <strong>Input/Output</strong> can be also classified as <strong>Digital/Analog</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Digital Devices</strong><br />
Examples include push buttons/switches that can either be ON(Logic HIGH) or OFF(logic LOW), these devices have discrete set of states in which they can exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Analog Devices</strong> <br />
Examples include LED, Motors, LDR these devices have a continuous set of states in which they can exist. For example an LED can stay turned ON with different amounts of brightness and a motor can be rotating at different speeds based on the control voltage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NOTE: Some devices can be both digital and analog based on how they are interfaced.</p>

<h3 id="digitalwrite">digitalWrite()</h3>
<p>Since digital devices usually have only two known states either HIGH(ON) or LOW(OFF), we will be using the <strong><a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/digital-io/digitalwrite/">digitalWrite()</a></strong> function to either make a pin go HIGH or LOW, therefore turning ON or OFF the external device connected to the Arduino pin.</p>

<p>A pin in its HIGH state is set to 5 Volts, a pin in LOW state has 0 Volts.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: A pin has to be set to OUTPUT using pinMode() before you can do a digitalWrite() on it</strong></p>

<p>Compile and upload the above sketch, you should see a tiny orange LED near the <strong>digital pin 13</strong> light up, congratulations on your first step towards getting to play with digital devices.</p>

<p>NOTE: Upload a new <strong>‚Äúblank sketch‚Äù</strong> after your done staring at the LED, if you don‚Äôt want it to be turned ON forever. Alternatively you can change the HIGH to LOW in the above sketch and upload it as well.</p>

<p>Now that we know how to turn ON an LED, let us go one step further and make it blink (Turn ON and OFF periodically).</p>

<p>The most intuitive way of doing this would be to first turn ON the LED and then turn it OFF and do this in a loop forever, which when translated into code looks like this</p>

<p><strong>Blinking Attempt 1</strong></p>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Compile and upload the above sketch and try to look very closely at the LED you should see it flicker very slightly, just kidding don‚Äôt strain your eyes too much you won‚Äôt be able to see it blink unless your Barry Allen, to help normal mortals make sense and visualise digital signals that are usually super fast humans have invented a few instruments (Logic Analyzers, Oscilloscope). I went ahead and connected a logic analyzer to see whats exactly happening to the LED in the above sketch.</p>

<p>Lo and behold, the LED does blink but it stays on for a mere fraction of 3.375 microseconds and stays off for another 3.375 microseconds, welcome to the world of an Arduino Uno, the ATmega328p thanks to the 16MHz external crystal runs at such incredible speeds due to which it appears like as if the LED has never been turned OFF.</p>

<p>Now that we know whats causing the problem its time we try to fix it.</p>

<h2 id="bitsian-standard-time---bst">Bitsian Standard Time - (BST)</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Bitsian Lore</strong><br />
 While the whole of India follows the India Standard Time we Bitsians unfortunately take pride in following the Bitsian Standard Time which basically is a time zone that runs anywhere from 10 to 40 minutes behind the IST, most event timings during fests are not inclusive of BST due to which participants from other colleges often think the events are <strong>delayed</strong>, if only there were as lite as we are.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="delay">delay()</h3>
<p>In great pride, lets meet the next function <strong><a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/time/delay/">delay()</a></strong> which is like the <strong>Bitsian Standard Time</strong> equivalent in the world of Arduino, while it does cause delays it isn‚Äôt as unpredictable as we bitsians are.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>delay()</strong> <br />
Pauses the program for the amount of time (in milliseconds) specified as parameter. (There are 1000 milliseconds in a second.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lets use the delay() function to stall the arduino for a second after and before changing the state of the LED.</p>

<p>Compile and upload the above sketch and viola, you should now finally have an blinking LED.</p>

<p>The above code in a logic analyzer looks like the following</p>

<p>As we can see the LED is on for almost a second, while not exact its close enough.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: Using delay() will cause your Arduino to sit idle for the specified amount of time without doing anything, which might be fine if our only intention is to blink an LED, but the use of delay should be avoided if we want the arduino to perform multiple tasks</strong></p>
