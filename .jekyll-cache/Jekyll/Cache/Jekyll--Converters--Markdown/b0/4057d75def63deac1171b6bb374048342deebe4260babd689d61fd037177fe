<p>To follow a wall (The wall refers to a boundary line of any shape) .The robot has to simply follow the wall wherever the wall leads to, the robot must go there.

<h2 id="working">WORKING</h2>
<p>This Robot Uses 3 Ultrasound Sensors(Left(l),Right(r),Center(c)).The Robot first moves forward.If the distance measured between any of the sensors and a wall is less than 12 cm then it means that a wall is found(sensor is active) and this has to followed. The robot responds in the way that is given in the table below.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>SENSOR ACTIVE</th>
      <th>RESPONSE</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>c only</td>
      <td>Turn right or left</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>r only</td>
      <td>Move Forward</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>l only</td>
      <td>Move forward</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>l and r</td>
      <td>Move forward</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>l and c</td>
      <td>Turn Right</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>r and c</td>
      <td>Turn Left</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>all sensors</td>
      <td>Turn 180 degree and Reverse.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>No Sensor</td>
      <td>Move forward</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>(before a wall is found)</p>

<p>9.No Sensor           STOP ,Turn Right Search for a wall,if not found come back to initial position,Then Turn Left And Search for a wall and start following it as soon as it is found.</p>

<p>(After A wall is found)</p>

<p>It is also made sure that the wall follower lies at a distance range of 3-10 cms from the wall According to the following table.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>SENSOR ACTIVE</th>
      <th>DISTANCE FROM WALL</th>
      <th>RESPONSE</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Left</td>
      <td>less than 3</td>
      <td>Turn Right</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Left</td>
      <td>greater than 10</td>
      <td>Turn Left</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Right</td>
      <td>less than 3</td>
      <td>Turn Left</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Right</td>
      <td>greater than 10</td>
      <td>Turn Right</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This will be helpful in case of walls which are not straight,round walls.It can even avoid obstacles of any shape.</p>

<p>The Robot Cannot Turn 90degree Perfectly near turnings  so there is a high chance it may  either collide with the wall or deviate slant wards.The above arrangement removes these difficulties.</p>
