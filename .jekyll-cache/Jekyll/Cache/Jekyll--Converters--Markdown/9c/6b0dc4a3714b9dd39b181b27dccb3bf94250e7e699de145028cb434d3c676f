<h1 id="how-to-make-connections-on-a-breadboard">How to make connections on a Breadboard?</h1>

<p>As mentioned before, a breadboard is a circuit board that is used to make temporary circuits. It is a device having electronics and test circuit designs. The electronic elements inside the electronic circuits can be interchanged by inserting the terminals and leads into holes and later connecting it with the help of appropriate wires.</p>

<p>The metal strips are laid out as shown below. Note that the top and bottom rows of holes are connected horizontally and split in the middle while the remaining holes are connected vertically.</p>

<h1 id="microcontrollers">Microcontrollers</h1>

<h2 id="what-is-a-microcontroller">What is a microcontroller?</h2>

<p>A microcontroller is a compact integrated circuit designed to govern a specific operation in an embedded system. A typical microcontroller includes a processor, memory, and input/output (I/O) peripherals on a single chip.</p>

<p>Also known as <em>embedded controllers or microcontroller units (MCUs)</em>, they are found in a variety of devices, including automobiles, robotics, office equipment, medical devices, mobile wireless transceivers, vending machines, and home appliances. They are essentially simple miniature personal computers (PCs) with no complex front-end operating system, designed to operate small features of a bigger component (OS).</p>

<p><img src="/site/assets/images/resources/Day1_Session1/microcontroller_block.png" alt="IR" width="auto" height="auto" /></p>

<p>Fig 1.1: Block Diagram of a Microcontroller</p>

<h2 id="how-do-microcontrollers-work">How do microcontrollers work?</h2>

<p>A microcontroller is embedded inside a system and controls a single function. It accomplishes this by employing its core Processor to evaluate data received from its I/O peripherals. The microcontroller‚Äôs temporary information is stored in its data memory, where the processor accesses it and decodes and applies the incoming data using instructions stored in its programme memory. It then communicates with its I/O peripherals and takes the required action.</p>

<h2 id="core-elements-of-a-microcontroller">Core Elements of a Microcontroller</h2>

<p><strong>The processor (CPU)</strong>
A processor might be compared to the device‚Äôs brain. It interprets and responds to a variety of commands that control the microcontroller‚Äôs operation. This includes basic arithmetic, logic, and input/output (I/O) operations. It also performs data transfer operations that send commands to other embedded system components.</p>

<p><strong>Memory</strong>
The memory of a microcontroller is used to retain the data that the processor receives and to respond to commands that it has been programmed to carry out. There are two types of memory in a microcontroller:</p>

<p><em>Program memory</em> is where the CPU keeps long-term information about the instructions it executes. Program memory is non-volatile memory, which means it may store data indefinitely without the need for a power source.</p>

<p><em>Data memory</em> is needed to store temporary data while the instructions are being executed. Data memory is volatile, which means that the data it stores is only transient and is only kept if the device is powered up.</p>

<p><strong>I/O peripherals</strong>
The processor‚Äôs input and output devices serve as its interface to the outside world. The input ports take in information and transfer it to the processor as binary data. The processor receives that data and sends the necessary instructions to output devices that execute tasks external to the microcontroller.</p>

<p>While the processor, memory, and I/O peripherals are the most important components of a microprocessor, other components are typically incorporated as well. Supporting components that interface with the memory and CPU are referred to as I/O peripherals. Peripherals are a broad category that includes a wide range of supporting components. Because they are the method via which the processor is applied, having some form of an I/O peripheral is essential to a microprocessor.</p>

<h2 id="supporting-elements-of-a-microcontroller">Supporting Elements of a Microcontroller</h2>

<p><strong>Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)</strong>
An ADC is a circuit that converts analog signals to digital signals. It allows the processor at the center of the microcontroller to interface with external analog devices, such as sensors.</p>

<p><strong>Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)</strong>
A DAC performs the inverse function of an ADC and allows the processor at the center of the microcontroller to communicate its outgoing signals to external analog components.</p>

<p><strong>System bus</strong>
The system bus is the connective wire that links all components of the microcontroller together.</p>

<p><strong>Serial port</strong>
The serial port is one example of an I/O port that allows the microcontroller to connect to external components. It has a similar function to a USB or a parallel port but differs in the way it exchanges bits.</p>

<h2 id="features-of-a-microcontroller">Features of a microcontroller</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>The processor of a microcontroller varies depending on the application.</em> Simple 4-bit, 8-bit, or 16-bit processors to more complicated 32-bit or 64-bit processors are available. Volatile memory types such as random access memory (RAM) and non-volatile memory types such as flash memory, erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), and electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) can be used by microcontrollers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Microcontrollers are designed to be easily useable without the use of extra computational components since they have enough onboard memory and pins for typical I/O activities, allowing them to directly communicate with sensors and other components.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Microcontrollers used assembly language exclusively when they initially became available. The C programming language is a common choice nowadays. Python and JavaScript are two other popular languages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Input and output pins on MCUs are used to implement peripheral functionality. Analog-to-digital converters, LCD controllers, real-time clocks (RTC), universal synchronous/asynchronous receiver transmitters (USART), timers, universal asynchronous receiver transmitter (UART), and USB connectivity are examples of such functions. Sensors that collect data on humidity and temperature, among other things, are frequently connected to microcontrollers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="some-applications-of-a-microcontroller">Some Applications of a Microcontroller</h2>

<p>Microcontrollers are utilised in a wide range of sectors and applications, including home and office automation, manufacturing, robotics, automotive, lighting, smart energy, industrial automation, communications, and IoT deployments.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A car</strong>, for example, may contain numerous microcontrollers that operate various internal systems such as <em>anti-lock braking, traction control, fuel injection, and suspension control</em>. To inform the correct actions, all the microcontrollers communicate with one another. Some microcontrollers may connect with the car‚Äôs more complex central computer, while others may only communicate with other microcontrollers. They use their I/O peripherals to send and receive data, which they then process to complete their tasks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Microcontrollers, even the simplest ones, make <strong>electromechanical systems like ovens, refrigerators, toasters, mobile devices, key fobs, video game systems, televisions, and lawn-watering systems</strong> easier to operate. They‚Äôre also found in <strong>photocopiers, scanners, fax machines, and printers</strong> in the office, as well as <strong>smart metres, ATMs, and security systems</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Microcontrollers with higher levels of sophistication are used in <strong>aeroplanes, spacecraft, ocean-going vessels, vehicles, medical and life-support systems, and robotics</strong>. Microcontrollers can control the functioning of an <strong>artificial heart, kidney, or other organ in medical applications</strong>. They can also play an important role in the operation of <strong>prosthetic devices</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="examples-of-microcontrollers">Examples of Microcontrollers</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Most Arduino boards consist of an <strong>Atmel 8-bit AVR microcontroller</strong> (ATmega8, ATmega168, ATmega328, ATmega1280, or ATmega2560)</li>
  <li>ARM is a family of microcontroller developed by makers like ST Microelectronics and Motorola.</li>

<h2 id="what-is-a-microprocessor">What is a microprocessor?</h2>

<p>A microprocessor is an integrated circuit (IC) that houses the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer . It is a clock-driven, register-based programmable multipurpose silicon device that accepts binary data as input and processes it according to instructions stored in the memory.</p>

<p><img src="/site/assets/images/resources/Day1_Session1/microprocessor_1.png" alt="IR" width="auto" height="auto" /></p>

<p>Fig 2.1:Microprocessor Block Diagram</p>

<h2 id="why-we-need-a-microprocessor">Why we need a Microprocessor?</h2>

<p>A microprocessor, like our brain, can be trained to perform any task. Based on its instruction set and capabilities, it can be programmed to perform anything we desire. When we try to solve a problem without programming, the solution can be exceedingly complex.</p>

<p>When we try to solve a problem without programming, the solution can be exceedingly complex.</p>

<p>Assume you wish to construct a large structure. The use of BRICKS will simplify and reduce the cost of building. It will also allow you to design the building in whatever shape or size you like. The bricks that you can employ to solve your problem are instructions stored in a microprocessor. You can quickly solve difficult programmes by following those guidelines.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-a-microprocessor-work-">How does a Microprocessor work ?</h2>

<p>A processor is the brain of a computer which basically consists of <em>Arithmetical and Logical Unit (ALU), Control Unit and Register Array</em>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ALU</strong> performs all arithmetic and logical operations on the data received from input devices or memory.</li>
  <li><strong>Register array</strong> consists of a series of registers like accumulator (A), B, C, D etc. which acts as temporary fast access memory locations for processing data.</li>
  <li><strong>Control Unit</strong> controls the flow of instructions and data throughout the system.</li>
</ul>

<p>So basically a microprocessor takes input from input devices, process it as per instructions given in the memory and produces output.</p>

<h2 id="common-terms-used-in-a-microprocessor">Common terms used in a Microprocessor</h2>

<p><strong>Bus</strong>
A bus is a collection of conductors that transfer data, address, or control information to various CPU units. A microprocessor typically has three types of buses: data, control, and address. An 8-bit wide bus will be used by an 8-bit processor.</p>

<p><strong>Instruction Set</strong>
A microprocessor‚Äôs instruction set is a collection of commands that it can understand. As a result, an instruction set serves as a link between hardware and software (program). An instruction instructs the processor to switch relevant transistors in order to perform data processing. ADD A, B, for example, is used to add two numbers in the registers A and B.</p>

<p><strong>Word Length</strong>
The number of bits in a processor‚Äôs internal data bus, or the number of bits a processor can handle at one time, is referred to as word length. As an example, An 8-bit processor has an 8-bit data bus, 8-bit registers, and only processes 8 bits at a time. It will divide higher-bit operations (32-bit and 16-bit) into a sequence of 8-bit operations.</p>

<p><strong>Cache Memory</strong>
Cache memory is a type of random access memory built into the CPU. As a result, the processor can retrieve data from the cache memory faster than from conventional RAM. CPU Memory is another name for it. Cache memory is used to store data or instructions that the software or programme refers to frequently during execution. As a result, the total pace of the process will improve.</p>

<p><strong>Clock Speed</strong>
A clock signal is used by microprocessors to govern the rate at which instructions are executed, as well as to synchronise other internal components and control data transfer. The speed at which a microprocessor executes instructions is referred to as clock speed. It is commonly stated in megahertz (MHz), gigahertz (GHz), and so on, and is measured in Hertz.</p>

<h2 id="risc--reduced-instruction-set-computer">RISC ‚Äì Reduced Instruction Set Computer</h2>

<p>RISC is a microprocessor architecture that employs a minimal, general-purpose, and highly optimised instruction set rather than a more specialised one seen in other architectures. RISC outperforms the CISC architecture in terms of performance Each instruction in a processor necessitates the use of a separate circuit to load and process the data. As a result, by lowering the number of instructions, the processor will be able to use simpler circuits and operate more quickly.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Simple instruction set</li>
  <li>Larger program</li>
  <li>Consists of large number of registers</li>
  <li>Simple processor circuitry (small number of transistors)</li>
  <li>More RAM usage</li>
  <li>Fixed length instructions</li>
  <li>Simple addressing modes</li>
  <li>Usually fixed number of clock cycles for executing one instruction</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cisc--complex-instruction-set-computer">CISC ‚Äì Complex Instruction Set Computer</h2>

<p>The CISC microprocessor architecture is the opposite of RISC. It‚Äôs designed to cut the amount of instructions per programme in half while ignoring the number of cycles per instruction. As a result, complicated instructions are directly implemented in hardware, resulting in a processor that is both complex and slow to operate.This architecture is actually designed to reduce the cost of memory by reducing the program length.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Complex instruction set</li>
  <li>Smaller program</li>
  <li>Less number of registers</li>
  <li>Complex processor circuitry (more number of transistors)</li>
  <li>Little RAM usage</li>
  <li>Variable length instructions</li>
  <li>Variety of addressing modes</li>
  <li>Variable number of clock cycles for each instructions</li>
  <li>Special Purpose Processors</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="advantages-of-microprocessors">Advantages of Microprocessors</h2>

<p><strong>Low Cost</strong>
Microprocessors are available at low cost due to integrated circuit technology which reduces the cost of a computer system.</p>

<p><strong>High Speed</strong>
Microprocessor chips can work at very high speed due to the technology involved in it. It is capable of executing millions of instructions per second.</p>

<p><strong>Small Size</strong>
Due to very large scale and ultra large scale integration technology, a microprocessor is fabricated in a very less footprint. This will reduce the size of the entire computer system.</p>

<p><strong>Versatile</strong>
Microprocessors are very versatile, the same chip can be used for a number of applications by simply changing the program (instructions stored in the memory).</p>

<p><strong>Low Power Consumption</strong>
Microprocessors are usually manufactured using metal oxide semiconductor technology, in which MOSFETs (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors) are working in saturation and cut off modes. So the power consumption is very low compared to others.</p>

<p><strong>Less Heat Generation</strong>
Compared to vacuum tube devices, semiconductor devices won‚Äôt emit that much heat.</p>

<p><strong>Reliable</strong>
Microprocessors are very reliable, failure rate is very less as semiconductor technology is used.</p>

<h1 id="introduction-to-arduino">Introduction to Arduino</h1>

<p>Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (a microcontroller) and a piece of software, or <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software">IDE</a> (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer and allows you to write and upload computer code to the physical board.</p>

<p>Arduino boards are able to read inputs such as lights on a sensor, pressure on a button, etc., and turn them into desired outputs such as activating a motor or turning on an LED. The set of instructions required to perform such tasks are given to the Arduino board using the IDE.</p>

<p>Unlike most previous programmable circuit boards, the Arduino does not need a separate piece of hardware (called a programmer) to load new code onto the board - you can simply use a USB cable. Additionally, the Arduino IDE uses a simplified version of C++, making the programming easier.</p>

<p>Arduino manufactures a wide range of boards. These have different sizes, different microcontrollers, and different processing capabilities.
The Uno is one of the most popular boards in the Arduino family and an excellent choice for beginners.</p>

<h2 id="main-components">Main components</h2>

<p><img src="/site/assets/images/resources/Day1_Session1/uno_components.png" alt="IR" width="auto" height="auto" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Power (USB):
The Arduino UNO is connected to a power source via a USB cable that is terminated in a barrel jack. The USB connection is also used to load code onto your Arduino board.
The recommended voltage for most Arduino models is between 6 and 12 Volts. A power supply greater than 20 Volts will damage the Arduino board.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pins:
The pins on the Arduino board are where the connections are made in order to construct the required circuit (in conjunction with a breadboard and connecting wires). The Arduino has several kinds of pins, each of which is used for a different purpose.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>5V and 3.3V Pins: These pins are used for power supply to the Arduino. 5V or 3.3V is sufficient for most of the simple components used.</li>
      <li>GND: These pins are used to ‚Äòground‚Äô the circuit.</li>
      <li>GPIO (General Purpose Input Output Pins): These are specific pins that are programmed to input/output signals.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>RX and TX LEDs:
RX and TX stand for Receiving and Transmitting, and these LEDs are used to indicate Serial communication (like when we‚Äôre loading a new program onto the board). The TX and RX LEDs blink whenever there is communication between the onboard microcontroller and the computer through the USB to serial converter chip present near the USB port. The lighting up of the LEDs indicates the direction of the flow of data. When a bit of data goes from the Arduino board to the computer, the TX LED glows. The RX LED glows when a bit of data goes from the computer to the Arduino board.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reset Switch:
This functions as a reset button. Pushing it will temporarily connect the reset pin to ground and restart any code that is loaded on the Arduino. This can be very useful if your code doesn‚Äôt repeat, but you want to test it multiple times.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Main IC:
This functions as the brain of the Arduino. The main IC on the Arduino is slightly different from board type to board type but is usually from the ATmega line of IC‚Äôs from the ATMEL company. This can be important, as you may need to know the IC type (along with your board type) before loading up a new program from the Arduino software. This information can usually be found in writing on the top side of the IC.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Voltage regulator:
It is used to regulate the power supply to the Arduino board. The regulator still has limitations, and hence a supply greater than 20 Volts must not be used as it may damage the board.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="arduino-uno">Arduino Uno</h2>

<p>Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the <a href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-7810-Automotive-Microcontrollers-ATmega328P_Datasheet.pdf">ATmega328P</a>. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable to get started.</p>

<h1 id="general-purpose-input-ouput-pins-gpio">General Purpose Input Ouput Pins (GPIO)</h1>

<p><img src="/site/assets/images/resources/Day1_Session1/gpio_1.png" alt="IR" width="auto" height="auto" /></p>

<p>GPIO pins are programmed to input/output signals. These bridge the gap between programming and electronics.
There are two types of GPIO pins:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Digital GPIO pins</li>
  <li>Analog GPIO pins</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/site/assets/images/resources/Day1_Session1/gpio_2.png" alt="IR" width="auto" height="auto" /></p>

<h2 id="1-digital-pins">1. Digital Pins</h2>

<p>The digital pins in the Arduino are labelled 0-13 (14 pins). These pins can be used for both digital input as well as digital output.</p>

<p>The pins on the Arduino that are marked with a tilde symbol (~) are known as PWM pins, and are used for analog output. On most Arduino boards (those with the ATmega168 or ATmega328), the PWM pins are 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11 (6 pins).
More information about PWM will be provided later.</p>

<p>Pin 13 of the Arduino Uno has a special function. It has an LED and a resistor attached to it. This makes it difficult to configure in the input modes.</p>

<p>Pins 0 and 1 (named RX and TX) are for serial connection and should not be used for other uses.</p>

<p><img src="/site/assets/images/resources/Day1_Session1/gpio_digital.png" alt="IR" width="auto" height="auto" /></p>

<p>In order to use the pins for digital input, the digitalRead() function is used.
In order to use the pins for digital output, the digitalWrite() function is used.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> - The digitalRead() and digitalWrite() functions will be explained later.</p>

<h2 id="2-analog-pins">2. Analog Pins</h2>

<p>The analog pins in the Arduino are labeled A0-A5 (6 pins). The Arduino has an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter. The converter has 10 bit resolution, returning integers from 0 to 1023. Hence the pins can read analog input voltages between 0 and the operating voltage (usually 5 V). This input is mapped to a value between 0 and 1023 appropriately using the analog to digital converter.</p>

<p>The analog pins are primarily used for analog input signals. But they can also be used like digital GPIO pins (HIGH or LOW input/output). Thus, pins marked as ‚ÄúANALOG IN‚Äù on the board can work either as analog input (using the Analog to Digital Converter), digital input, or digital output.</p>

<p><img src="/site/assets/images/resources/Day1_Session1/gpio_analog.png" alt="IR" width="auto" height="auto" /></p>

<p>In order to use the pins for reading <strong>analog</strong> input signals, analogRead() function is used.
<strong>NOTE</strong> - You will learn more about the analogRead() function in the further sessions.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> - The analogWrite() function is reserved to PWM pins. A more detailed explanation of PWM pins, their function, and the analogWrite() function will be provided later.</p>

<h1 id="digital-vs-analog">Digital Vs Analog</h1>

<p>By the time you are reading this, you would be having a fair idea of what an Arduino is, and what exactly are GPIO pins. On a brief note, Arduino is a microcontroller, while GPIO pins stand for General Purpose Input Output pins. These GPIO pins are further classified into Digital and Analog pins. Now let‚Äôs look into what these are and by the end of this document let‚Äôs try to make a small circuit using Arduino and a LED.</p>

<p>Before we look into Digital and Analog pins, let‚Äôs see what are Digital and Analog Signals.</p>

<h2 id="signals">Signals</h2>

<p>Signals, in electrical engineering, mean <strong><em>time-varying</em></strong> quantities, usually voltages. These signals are of two types, one is Digital Signal, other is Analog Signal.</p>

<h3 id="digital-signals">Digital Signals</h3>

<p>Digital signals refer to signals which are finite or discrete. Meaning different values passed by these signals are finite. For example, in Arduino the digital signals that can be passed are two, <strong>**$5V$ and $0V$</strong>**. They can be more than two too. But remember, Digital signals are never infinite.</p>

<p><img src="/site/assets/images/resources/Day1_Session1/digital.png" alt="IR" width="auto" height="auto" /></p>

<p><em>This is how a Digital Signal looks like.</em></p>

<h3 id="analog-signals">Analog Signals</h3>

<p>Unlike Digital signals, Analog Signals are infinite. Meaning it can take any number of values, but usually restricted in an continues interval. For example, in Arduino, the Analog signals sent can <strong><em>vary between $0V$ and $5V$, both inclusive</em></strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/site/assets/images/resources/Day1_Session1/analog.png" alt="IR" width="auto" height="auto" /></p>

<p><em>This is how a Analog Signal looks like.</em></p>

<h2 id="building-your-first-arduino-circuit--blinking-an-led">Building your first Arduino Circuit : Blinking an LED</h2>

<p>Now that you have gained a basic understanding of digital and analog pins, let‚Äôs build a simple circuit using an Arduino. For this circuit, we will be using <strong>an Arduino, a LED, and a resistor</strong>. The circuit connection looks as below :</p>

<p><img src="/site/assets/images/resources/Day1_Session1/led_uno.png" alt="IR" width="auto" height="auto" /></p>

<p>By the above circuit connection and the usage of the above code, the LED will blink until the Arduino is given power.</p>

<p>For Simulation of the circuit check the following <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/6NIZm9eNqsL">link.</a></p>

<p>There maybe a lot in the above code that you might not understand at present, but still try to copy the code and replicate the circuit and run the simulation. This will help you grasp the concepts better in the later sessions.</p>

<h1 id="pwm">PWM</h1>

<p>By now you must be fairly familiar with GPIO pins (Digital and Analog pins). Now let‚Äôs discuss about PWM and a special set of Digital pins, called PWM pins.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pulse Width Modulation, or PWM, is a technique for getting analog results with digital means.</li>
  <li>Digital control is used to create a square wave, a signal switched between on and off. This on-off pattern can simulate voltages in between the full Vcc of the board (e.g., 5 V on Uno, 3.3 V on a MKR board) and off (0 Volts) by changing the portion of the time the signal spends on versus the time that the signal spends off.</li>
  <li>The duration of ‚Äúon time‚Äù is called the pulse width. To get varying analog values, you change, or modulate, that pulse width.</li>
  <li>If you repeat this on-off pattern fast enough with an LED for example, the result is as if the signal is a steady voltage between 0 and Vcc controlling the brightness of the LED.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="duty-cycle">Duty Cycle</h2>

<p>When the Arduino sends a $5V$ signal we can call it ‚Äúon time‚Äù. Now Duty Cycle is defined as the ratio of on time by total time :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Duty Cycle = t<sub>ON</sub>/(t<sub>ON</sub>+t<sub>OFF</sub>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Average voltage is :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>V<sub>average</sub> = $5V$ X Duty Cycle</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, Duty Cycle specifically describes the percentage of time a digital signal in ON (5V) over an interval or period of time.</p>

<p><img src="/site/assets/images/resources/Day1_Session1/pwm_1.png" alt="IR" width="auto" height="auto" /></p>

<h2 id="pwm-pins">PWM Pins</h2>

<p>PWM pins are special-purpose Digital pins that are capable of sending voltage signals between $0V$ and $5V$ too.</p>

<p>Let us consider a simple circuit consisting of an LED, a resistor, a pushbutton, and an Arduino. When the pushbutton is pressed, the LED turns ON because it receives a 5V voltage. When the pushbutton is released, the LED turns OFF because it does not receive any voltage as the circuit is broken, or in other words, it receives 0V. This is demonstrated below using an oscilloscope.</p>

<p><em>When pushbutton is pressed, 5V output</em></p>

<p><img src="/site/assets/images/resources/Day1_Session1/pwm_2.png" alt="IR" width="auto" height="auto" /></p>

<p><em>When pushbutton is released, 0V output</em></p>

<p><img src="/site/assets/images/resources/Day1_Session1/pwm_3.png" alt="IR" width="auto" height="auto" /></p>

<p>Now let‚Äôs say you want to control the brightness of the LED instead of having a simple ON-OFF circuit. This can be achieved using the PWM pins on the Arduino, by varying the portion of time for which the signal stays ON (5V) versus the time for which the signal stays OFF (0V). This is demonstrated below using an oscilloscope.</p>

<p><img src="/site/assets/images/resources/Day1_Session1/pwm_4.png" alt="IR" width="auto" height="auto" /></p>

<h3 id="where-are-they-present-on-the-arduino">Where are they present on the Arduino?</h3>

<p>Identifying a PWM pin is an easy task. There are 6 PWM pins in total in an Arduino (3,5,6,9,10,11). If we observe we can see that the above-mentioned pins are accompanied by a ‚Äò~‚Äô symbol. This is the indication saying that a particular pin is a PWM pin. See the picture below :</p>

<p><img src="/site/assets/images/resources/Day1_Session1/pwm_pins.png" alt="IR" width="auto" height="auto" /></p>

<h3 id="sending-analog-signals-using-pwm-pins">Sending Analog Signals using PWM pins</h3>

<p>For usage purposes, the PWM pins are of $8-bit$ resolution is used. In this, voltages varying between $0V$to $5V$ are divided into 256 (2<sup>8</sup>, hence $8-bit$ resolution) parts, such that $0V$ is $0$ and $5V$ is $255$. Using this we can send analog signals through PWM pins. As to how we do that will be covered in the upcoming topics.</p>
