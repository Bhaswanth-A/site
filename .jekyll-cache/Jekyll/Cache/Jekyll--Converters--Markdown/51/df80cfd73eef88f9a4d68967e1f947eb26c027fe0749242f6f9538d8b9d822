<p>To make an autonomous robot which can respond to sound/claps.

<h2 id="hardware-used">Hardware used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 – Arduino Uno</li>
  <li>2 – Analog sound sensors (one on each side of the bot).</li>
  <li>2 – 100 rpm geared motors.</li>
  <li>1 – L293D H-bridge motor driver.</li>
  <li>1– Regular sized castor wheel for support.</li>
  <li>1 – External 9v power supply for Arduino as well as motors.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>The bot works on the fact that when sound is in a certain direction, the sensor closer to it measures a higher change in value (of amplitude/intensity) than the sensor away from it due to sound attenuation i.e. if the sound is to the right of the bot, the right sensor detects a higher change in sound intensity than the left sensor. Hence it moves to the right according to the code.</p>
