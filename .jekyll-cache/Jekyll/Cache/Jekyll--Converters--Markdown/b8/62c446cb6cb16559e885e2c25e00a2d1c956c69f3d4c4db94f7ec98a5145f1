<p>This is a basic project to control a bot or any other appliance wirelessly using RF Module. It provides 4 output channels which can be increased or decreased by minor changes in the code.</p>

<h2 id="hardware-used">Hardware Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Arduino Mega</li>
  <li>Arduino Uno R3</li>
  <li>RF transmitter &amp; Receiver module 433MHz</li>
  <li>Breadboard</li>
  <li>DC motors</li>
  <li>Some jumper wires</li>
  <li>12V adapter</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The transmitter was connected with the Arduino Uno and some push buttons to take inputs as a remote control.</p>

<p>The receiver was connected to mega and output pins were further extended to a relay board, which in this case was used as Dual H-Bridge to control motors. This relay board can be replaced with a common relay board to control electrical appliances for home automation using the same code. The relay board was powered with a 12V adapter.

<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<p>Whenever a push button is pressed the corresponding pin changes it states either HIGH or LOW.</p>

<h3 id="transmitter-code">Transmitter code</h3>
<p>Virtual Wire lib was used to use RF.</p>

<p>Pin no 12 was used as data pin for Tx .Pin no 7,6,5,4 were used as input pins for remote.</p>

<p>Code can be found <a href="https://github.com/rajatbansal427/RF-bot-controll-Room-automation/blob/master/transmitter_ro_aut.ino">here</a></p>

<h3 id="receiver-code">Receiver code</h3>
<p>The Rx receives an string of characters in a message which is stored as buf[] and buflen is the max no of characters in the string.</p>

<p>The Boolean data type is used to toggle state.</p>
