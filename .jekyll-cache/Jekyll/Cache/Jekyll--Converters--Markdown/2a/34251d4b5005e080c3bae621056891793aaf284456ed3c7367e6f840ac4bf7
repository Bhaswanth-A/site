<p>Carpal Tunnel syndrome is a common problem with people who are involved in desk-work, working with a traditionally designed mouse, or a pointing device to be more specific. EasyMouse aims to make a pointing device optimised for gaming, based solely on gestures. As a result, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is avoided in the long run.</p>
