# General flow of the Level Up Program
The initial five levels of the LevelUp Program deals with basic Arduino programming and CAD modelling. And Level 6 deals with Linux environment, Python programming, NumPy and OpenCV libraries, followed by an introduction to ROS(Robotics Operating System) in Level 7.

# Getting Started 
Before we get to the learning section, we need to create an account on TinkerCad, a web-based tool that allows you to simulate Arduino-based systems.
Similarly, we will also need an account on the Onshape platform, a cloud-based computer-aided design (CAD) software.
These tutorials will show you how to create these accounts.
