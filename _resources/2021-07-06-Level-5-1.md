# Programming and Electronics

# Prerequisites

- Data Types
- Control Blocks - if/else
- Sequential Iteration - Loops

# A Brief Outline

- Arrays and Pointers
- Scopes
- Functions
- Sensors: The Ultrasonic Sensor

## Arrays

A collection of objects with the same datatype.

Remember Strings? Try implementing your own strings with this knowledge.

Sample Code:

```c++
int iArr[6];

float fArr[] = {1.0f, 2.0f, 3.3f, 4.2f}

// Does this work?
long lArr[6] = {1, 2, 3};

//Does this work? What changes if not?
char str[ ] = "abcdef";
```

Indexing of an Array

## Accessing Elements

Note the following points about arrays while accessing elements:

- 0 indexed: i.e. first element is at position (or index) 0.
- if array of length 'n' last element at index 'n-1'.
    (What is there at index n?)

Sample Code:

```c++
int iArr[6] = {0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5};

// iArr[3] == 2

// Invalid Syntax:
// iArr[6], iArr[7], iArr[-1]

//Set the 5th element to 420

iArr[4] = 420;
```

**Exercise:** Try printing all the elements of an array on the Serial Monitor.

## Memory

SRAM - Static Random Access Memory

- It stores (almost) all the data required during operation.
- Memory can be allocated statically (creating variables, static arrays, etc.) - Stored on the **stack**.
- Memory can be allocated Dynamically - Stored on the **heap**.
- We'll look at dynamic allocation soon!

## Pointers

- Every variable has an address on the memory.
- 2 bytes or 16 bits of data
- How do we access these addresses?
- What is the point of accessing them?

```c++
int a = 5;

//Declaring a pointer
int *ptr;

//ptr point to the memory address of a 
ptr = &a;

// Setting b to be the value of a
int b = *ptr; //Dereferencing Operation
```

>Notice the two very different uses of the * operator.


### Block Diagram Explanation

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resources/Level 5/arr1.PNG" alt="arr1" width=600px height=auto>


- &a returns the memory address of the variable 'a'
- From the block diagram above: `&a=0x1A6`

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resources/Level 5/arr2.PNG" alt="arr2" width=600px height=auto>

- *ptr = &a
- This sets the ptr variable (of type- integer **POINTER**) to have the value 0x1A6 in hex, or 422 in decimal

> Notice that the address of ptr is behind a, even though it was declared after. Remember how the memory for these variables were statically allocated, i.e. on the stack. This behavior is owing to the fact that the stack counter starts from the last memory address and moves backward. However note that this behaviour is architecture dependent)



<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resources/Level 5/arr3.PNG" alt="arr3" width=600px height=auto>



- b = *ptr
- The * is the derefrencing operator when used before a pointer.
- It returns the value at the address stored in the pointer(ptr) that is a.


## Dynamic Memory Allocation

- Dynamic allocation means reserving space on the heap memory.
- You can choose the size of the reserved space at runtime.
- **Use the 'new' keyword**.
- The memory that is allocated must be freed after it isn't required.
- **Free using the 'delete' keyword** .

```c++
// Creating a new integer pointer
// Ptr points to a location on the heap
int *ptr = new int(5);
delete ptr; // Freeing the memory

// Dynamically Allocated Arrays!!
int n; // Take input and initialize
int *arr = new int[n];
delete[ ] arr; // Freeing the memory
```

>Notice the ( ) when dynamically creating an integer & \[ ] when dynamically creating an array.

## User Defined Functions

- Functions are subroutines, or small fragments of code.
- They can take parameters and can return output.

```c++
<type> name([ <type> [name], ...] ) {
    // Some Code
     return <data:type>
}

int walk(int speed, int x) {
    x += speed;
    return x;
}
```

Syntax is expressed through convention.

1.  <> : have relevant placeholders, eg: `<type>`
2. [ ]: optional items; May or may not exist for proper functioning.

## Why Functions?

- Functions typically perform a singular task and return a result.
- Typical Use case is when you need to repeat the same code multiple times with slight variation.
- Provide a level of abstraction to the code and reduces repetition.

```c++
int myCoordinate = 0, mySpeed = 1;

int walk( int speed, int x) {
    x += speed;
    return x;
}

// void because it does not return anything
void setup( ) { }

void loop( ) { 
    myCoordinate = walk(mySpeed, myCoordinate);
    delay(100);
}
```

1.  After approximately how much time, if at all does the value of myCoordinate become 0 again?
2.  Check out passing variables by reference and improve this code. Specifically Line 12.

## A New Sensor has Appeared!

**Ultrasonic Sensor: HC SR04**

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resources/Level 5/hcsr04.png" alt="hcsr04" width=500px height=auto>

Working:

1.  Emit a pulse (8 pulses) (Why the number 8?)
2.  Pulse Reflected by Object.
3.  Measure the time delay in detection of the reflected pulse from the emission of the initial pulse.

This time delta is proportional to distance of object.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1

Calculate the velocity of an object moving with constant velocity using the HC SR04 Sensor. Assume that the velocity vector of the object points directly towards or away from the HC SR04 transmitter/receiver. (Ignore Doppler Effect)

### Assignment 2

Use this velocity calculated in previous question to calculate the distance of the object after a given time interval. Measure the distance using the HC SR 04 sensor and calculate the error. (Ignore Doppler Effect)

### Assignment 3

How would you measure the speed of sound in water using the HC SR04 Sensor and the Arduino UNO? What other materials are required? Try to think solutions as creative as possible.
