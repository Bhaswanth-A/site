## Assignment 1
As the world is moving towards Autonomous Vehicles obstacle detection is a basic requirement for the vehicle to move safely without bumping into objects. Obstacle Avoider is an intelligent device that can automatically sense the obstacle in front of it and avoid them by slowing down or turning in the other direction.

### Problem Statement
- The speed of the motor involved in rotating the wheel of the obstacle avoidance bot should be linearly dependent on the distance(between 0-100).
- If distance is 0 then speed 0.
- If distance is 100cm speed full.

## Assignment 2

IR controlled motors. As we have controlled the directions of motor using basic code. Now we want our motors to be controlled by a touchless switch.

### Problem Statement

Motors should run in any one direction.
If IR sensor detects your hand, the motor should change the direction.
If it detects your hand again, it goes back to spinning in original direction and so on.
