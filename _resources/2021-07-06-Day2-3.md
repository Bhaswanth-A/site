## Electronics Assignment

#### Q1 - Demonstrate the Wheatstone bridge practically *using real components included in your kit* by connecting 5 LEDs and 5 resistors as a bridge circuit. See how 4 LEDs light up while the 5th LED, which is bridged, doesn't glow. The connections have to be made as shown in the circuit diagram below.

#### Q2 - As you know now in times of Covid-19 many people gathering in a small shop can cause probems. So, in today's assignment, you have to design a **bidirectional visitor counter** using IR (Infra-red) Sensor. 
 
The working would be as follows:
1. There will be 2 IR sensors placed at the entrance. 
2. They would detect if the person enters the room or exits. 
3. If the person enters total count increases by 1 else if person extis then count decreases by 1
4. Everytime there's a movement you have to Serial print the number of people in the room.
 
The output should look like this.

#### Bonus
You can update it to have automatic lights in the room.
1. If no. of people is zero then lights off.
2. If no. of people >0 lights on.

Your Assembly will include the following parts:
1. Acrylic Chassis
2. Acrylic Tabs
3. BO Motor
4. Wheel

Use appropriate mates for your assembly. Make sure that your wheels rotate on the motor's axle.

>Note: Check out the **Offset** option while using Mates.
