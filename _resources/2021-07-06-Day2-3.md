## Assignment
 
As you know now in times of Covid-19 many people gathering in a small shop can cause probems. So, in today's assignment, you have to design a **bidirectional visitor counter** using IR (Infra-red) Sensor. 
 
The working would be as follows:
1. There will be 2 IR sensors placed at the entrance. 
2. They would detect if the person enters the room or exits. 
3. If the person enters total count increases by 1 else if person extis then count decreases by 1
4. Everytime there's a movement you have to Serial print the number of people in the room.
 
The output should look like this.
 
<div>{%- include extensions/youtube.html id='VornMG97Y-A' -%}</div>
 
### Bonus
You can update it to have automatic lights in the room.
1. If no. of people is zero then lights off.
2. If no. of people >0 lights on.
