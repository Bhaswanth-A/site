## PIR

PASSIVE INFRARED SENSOR:

- PIR sensors are made of pyroelectric material, which is used to detect the levels of infrared radiation in the surroundings. The way this sensor works is actually quite interesting and is nicely explained [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/pir-passive-infrared-proximity-motion-sensor/how-pirs-work).
- Follow the link to go to the [datasheet](https://www.epitran.it/ebayDrive/datasheet/44.pdf).

## Voltage Regulator 7805 IC

- Voltage regulators are used to ensure steady and constant output from voltage sources.
- The integrated circuits used for voltage regulation are called Voltage regulator ICs.
- The 7805 IC is one of 78xx series. More information about 7805 and its components can be found [here](https://www.electronicshub.org/understanding-7805-ic-voltage-regulator/).

| Pin No. | Pin | Function | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | INPUT | Input Voltage (7V-35V) | In this pin of the IC positive unregulated voltage is given in regulation |
| 2   | GROUND | Ground(0V) | In this pin where the ground is given. This pin is neutral for equally the input and output |
| 3   | OUTPUT | regulated output; 5V(4.8V-5.2V) | The output of the regulated 5V is taken out at this pin of the IC regulator |

## Servo Motor

- Servos are widely used in rotating joints and are found in variable sizes.
- Servo motor is an electrical device that can push or rotate an object with greater precision.
- A Servo consists of a motor (AC or DC), a potentiometer, gear assembly, and a controlling circuit.
- The position of the servo motor is decided by the electrical pulse given to the signal wire.

## DC Motor and L293D

- The Motors also come in different sizes and types, the most common ones are the normal DC motor and the Brushless DC motor (BLDC).
- The DC Motor as we all have studied from our school days runs by placing a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field.
- Since the magnets are already present, we only need to provide the DC current.
- However, the speed and direction of rotation depend on the voltage provided. For this, we use a motor driver such as an L293D
- It’s a 16-pin motor driver IC (see diagram) which can drive to dc motors simultaneously in any direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise).

### More about L293D

Input pins: The ones to which we give signals
Output pins: The ones connected to the motors.

- We give power to the motors via VCC2 (the actual range is 4.5-36V, but for general motors, 9-12V is good) and power up the IC (5V) via VCC1.
- The enable pins are there to “enable” the output pins. If enable pins are set to logic HIGH then the output pins match up to the input pins.
- If the enable pins are set to logic LOW then regardless of logic states of input pins, the output pins are always set to zero.
- There is a notch on the top of the IC, to guide us with proper connections.
- The IC uses an “H-Bridge” which helps control the direction of rotation of motors.

# Assignments

## Assignment 1

You have to simulate a mini-segway (2 wheels only) that avoids obstacles. It takes a 90 degrees(approx) turn on every obstacle detected. For detecting an object you should use 2 PIR Sensors, one for detecting an obstacle on the left side and one for detecting an obstacle on the right side.
The path of the segway should be as follows -

1.  It goes straight until no object is detected on either side.
2.  It takes a 90 degree left turn if the object is detected on the
    right side and then goes straight.
3.  It takes a 90 degree right turn if the object is detected on the
    left side and then goes straight.

An example path (Approximate path) -

Specifications :
Radius of wheel = 30 cm
Distance between two wheels = 1 m
At All points rpm of both wheels should be approx 5000 rpm.
Bonus points for those who reduce their rpm to approx 2000 rpm while turning.

Assumptions -

1.  You can assume that the motors can reach 0 rpm in a negligible
    amount of time.
2.  There is sufficient friction so that no slipping takes place.

The time taken by the segway to rotate 90 degrees can be calculated as follows -

Your setup on TinkerCAD should look something like this -
