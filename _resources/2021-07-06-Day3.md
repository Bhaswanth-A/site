# Introduction to Control Systems

### Dynamic System

A dynamic system is an entity to which to we give an input $u(t)$ and we get an output $y(t)$.
Time is the independent variable and all other variables that are associated with the system are functions of time.

> A system is a collection of objects or a process that is under study.

Mathmatecially we can visualzie a dynamic system as a mapping $S(.):u(t) \to y(t)$.
That is $y(t) = S(u(t))$.

## Classification of Dynamic Systems

### **SISO vs MIMO**

**SISO(Single Input Single Output)**
$u(.):\R \to \R, t \in \R$
$y(.):\R \to \R, t \in \R$
**MIMO(Multiple Input Multiple Output)**
If we have m inputs and p outputs,
$u(.):\R \to \R^m$
$y(.):\R \to \R^p$

### **Linear vs Non-Linear**

**Linear**

> Principle of superposition is satisfied by linear systems

### **Time Invariant vs Time Varying**

A time invariant system is one that provides the same output for the given input irrespective of when the input is given.
Mathematically, if $y(t) = S(u(t))$, then time invariance is given as,
$y(t-T) = S(u(t-T))$ $\forall T \in \R$.

### **Causal vs Non-Causal**

**Causal**
A causal system is one where the output at any instant of time depends only on past and current inputs.

> A causal system is non-anticipatory.

Therefore, we will be studying **Single Input Single Output, Linear, Time Invariant, Causal, Dynamic Systems.**

> **Approach for implementing controllers**
> 1) Develope the mathematical model
> 2) Analyze the system responce
> 3) Deisgn the controller.

### Problem Variations

**Synthsis**
Given $u(t)$ & $y(t)$ find $S(.)$

**Analysis/Prediciton**
Given $S(.)$ & $u(t)$, find $y(t)$

**Control**
Given $S(.)$ & $y(t)$, find $u(t)$

# Overview of Feedback Control Systems

### Closed Loop Control - Negative Feedback

When there is a mapping in the feedback path to account for sensor dynamics its called a non-unity feedback path, else its called a unity feedback path.
