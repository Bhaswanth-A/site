Hey! Congratulations on making it to the second CAD session of our workshop.

In this section, you will be learning how to
- Work with 3D Onshape Tools 
- Import parts into an assembly
- Make a working assembly with mates!


# Extrude

The basic extrude tool gives a 3-D feature to a 2-D obect.

Once you have finished drawing a sketch in Onshape the 3-D toolbar appears and you can now use extrude on your sketch.

Here is a simple example 

<div>{%- include extensions/youtube.html id='WHI0Jxq0p48' -%}</div>


## Types of extrude

Other than converting a 2-D object into a 3-D one the extrude tool can also modify an existing 3-D object by adding or removing material, or intersecting parts in its path.

The various types extrude are explained below:

* ### New
As seen in the last clip this option converts a 2-D object into a 3-D object.

* ### Add
This option adds extrude onto an existing 3-D object.

<div>{%- include extensions/youtube.html id='JCL8uEXLr-8' -%}</div>

* ### Remove
Instead of adding this option removes material from an existing 3-D object.

<div>{%- include extensions/youtube.html id='H2G0nnhlKsU' -%}</div>

* ### Intersect 
This option leaves material only where intersections exist between different objects.


<div>{%- include extensions/youtube.html id='BqmFZSSvCB8' -%}</div>


## Amount of extrude
The amount of extrude can be controlled by providing one of the options given below.

* Blind: To a specified distance (as entered in the Depth field).
* Up to next: Up to the next face or faces encountered in the specified direction.
* Up to face: Up to the infinite face underlying the selected face or plane.
* Up to part:  Up to the next part encountered in the specified direction.
* Up to vertex: Up to a selected point (vertex) 
* Through all: Through all selected parts.

## Few other options in extrude
* **Draft**
The draft option provides a taper of the specified angle to the extrusion.

<div>{%- include extensions/youtube.html id='0FKxw38VaXo' -%}</div>


* **Symmetric**
Symmetric option basically does the same extrusion on both the sides of a particular surface.

<div>{%- include extensions/youtube.html id='md78fU1A-rU' -%}</div>


* **Second end position**
Using this option we can provide a different type of extrusion on the other side of a surface.

<div>{%- include extensions/youtube.html id='fud6iO2uOzI' -%}</div>


## Example

Here is an example of a spinner using extrude.

# Sweep,Revolve and Loft
These tools are similar to the basic extrude tool in the sense it gives a 3-D feature to a 2-D object.

## Revolve
The new option in revolve tool requires you to select a surface and an axis. It then creates parts by revolving sketch regions or planar faces about the provided axis.

Here are a few examples


<div>{%- include extensions/youtube.html id='id0NPu4uJxI' -%}</div>

Revolve has the same options as extrude tool which include:

*  New 
*  Add
*  Remove
*  Intersect

So we can create, add to, subtract from, or intersect parts by revolving sketch regions or planar faces about a central axis as we did in extrude.

### Amount of revolve

By default the revolve angle is set to 360 degrees (Full option).

In order to specify the amount of revolve we must change this option to one-direction,symmetric or two direction and provide the required angle.

## Sweep
The sweep tool requires you to select a surface and a path perpendicular to the surface.
It then extrudes the 2-D surface along the given path resulting in a 3-D object.

<div>{%- include extensions/youtube.html id='EdoDnWBRa1g' -%}</div>


Again using sweep we can also modify an existing obect by adding or removing material, or intersecting parts in its path.

## Planes and Loft

### Planes
Before using the loft tool we will look a bit into planes,as the loft tool is used with respect to planes.

Usually there are 3 planes in Onshape- Front,Right and Top. 
You can hide/unhide these planes according to you convienience while drawing.

We can also create new planes according to our convienience using the plane tool.
We have to select a particular surface/plane and put in the required offset distance to create a new plane parallel to the selected plane/surface.

<div>{%- include extensions/youtube.html id='bG_zzAzHjRU' -%}</div>

### Loft

The loft tool allows smooth transition between two or more surfaces/shapes present in parallel planes.

Lets see an example

<div>{%- include extensions/youtube.html id='w82IzBDUv3s' -%}</div>

Similar to the tools we have seen till now loft has options of New,Add,Remove as well as intersect.

#### More options in Loft

* **Adjusting profile**

The loft tool has an option to provide the end profile condition and the start profile condition.

These provide options to change how the surfaces connect each other.

Both the start and the end profile condition have the following options which can be used as required.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resources/Day2_Session2/loft.JPG" alt="IR" width=auto height=auto>


* **Path**

We can also provide the path along which we want our loft to connect.
This option along with intermediate sections can really make a huge difference in how the surfaces connect.
Here is an example


Loft with no path:

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resources/Day2_Session2/path_1.png" alt="IR" width=auto height=auto>


Loft with path and 2 intermediate sections:

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resources/Day2_Session2/path_2.png" alt="IR" width=auto height=auto>

Loft with path and 20 intermediate sections:

# Assemblies

Once we create the required parts the only thing left is to assemble them in order to make the final object/robot.

An Onshape assembly tab is where you define degrees of freedom and relations between different parts.

## Starting an Assembly

Every Onshape file comes with a Part Studio and Assembly tab at the bottom.
Part Studio is where we have been making our sketches and parts whereas the assembly tab is where we will be bringing those parts together and defining relations between them.
We can make multiple part studios and assemblies in an Onshape document.

### Importing parts

You can either import parts from the Part Studio of the same Onshape file or some other Onshape file using the Insert option in the assembly tab.

Here is how we import parts in the assembly tab:


<div>{%- include extensions/youtube.html id='WEQ-rTs-rWQ' -%}</div>


- One of the important part in building an assembly is fixing one of the parts to the origin.
- Rest of the parts can be moved around this fixed part.
- The triad manipulator can be used for more control when moving parts.

Once we have imported all the parts to be assembled,The only thing left is to define relations between these parts ie. how they should move with respect to each other.

This is done using mates which will be explained in the next section.

***

# Mates

There can only be one Onshape Mate between any two parts, and the movement (degrees of freedom) between those two parts is embedded in the Mate. At the time of placing a mate between two entities, Onshape will offer points on each entity to which to align with the mate's coordinate system.

There are different mates for different purposes.
The axes mentioned in the following list are with respect to the mates' coordinate system and not with respect to that of the assembly.

## Types of Mates

### 1. Fastened Mate

This mate restricts degrees of freedom of individual parts essentially combining the 2 parts into one. It is as if you welded them or bolted (fastened) them together.

<div>{%- include extensions/youtube.html id='fbae00T7wqI' -%}</div>

<br>

### 2. Revolute Mate

This mate relates 2 entities to rotate about the required axis. All degrees of motion are restricted except rotation of about the Z axis. This is used while modelling for a wheel.

<div>{%- include extensions/youtube.html id='yZ1fVoPnb4k' -%}</div>

<br>

### 3. Slider Mate

This mate relates 2 entities to such that one entity moves along the second entity. All degrees of motion are restricted except the motion along the Z axis. it is used while modelling a piston.

<div>{%- include extensions/youtube.html id='brs3jW4zqVo' -%}</div>

<br>

### 4. Planar Mate

This mate relates the movement of 2 entities. it restricts the motion of one entity to the X and Y axes and allows its rotation relative to the second entity.


<div>{%- include extensions/youtube.html id='ajL99WqCobc' -%}</div>

<br>

### 5. Cylindrical Mate

This mate is combination of the Revolute and the Slider Mates and hence does the function of both. That is, translation along the Z axis and rotation about the Z axis.

<div>{%- include extensions/youtube.html id='cqtfcyb7Aj4' -%}</div>

<br>

### 6. Pin Slot Mate

Similar to the Cylindrical Mate, this mate is along a combination of the Revolute and the Slider mates. The difference between the two is that for Pin Slot Mate the translation is along the X axis. That is, translation along the X axis and rotation about the Z axis. The first Mate connector selected serves as the pin and the rotational movement point. The second Mate connector selected serves as the translational movement.

<div>{%- include extensions/youtube.html id='X_mZ5chilE8' -%}</div>

<br>

### 7. Ball Mate

This mate allows the rotation of one entity about all the 3 axes: X,Y and Z. The translational motion is restricted along all the axes.

<div>{%- include extensions/youtube.html id='UYSfjEhFERM' -%}</div>

<br>

### 8. Parallel Mate

Mates two entities allowing individual translational movement along any axis, and parallel rotation along any axis.

<div>{%- include extensions/youtube.html id='M2JEV74HaDs' -%}</div>

<br>

### 9. Tangent Mate

Mate two entities tangent to the selected faces, edges, or vertices. This mate does not prevent the translation nor the rotation of either of the objects but always maintains a tangential point of the actual object or a projection of the object.


<div>{%- include extensions/youtube.html id='iIZ4oxS79EA' -%}</div>

<br>

## Other Features to be used with Mates
### General

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resources/Day2_Session2/mate_1.png" alt="IR" width=auto height=auto>

The bottom leftmost icon is used to change the direction of the primary axis (often the Z axis) during the creation of the mate.
The icon to the right of this is used to rotate the entity about the Z axis to suit the needs of the model and the mate. This is reorienting the secondary axes.
The play button is for mates with moving degrees of freedom such as the Revolute Mate and the Ball Mate. This would be used to test if the mate is working as intended and to change the limits or offsets if required.
Solve is used to set the objects as they are in the rest of the project and test if there are any physical discrepancies.

There is a drop down list for the type of Mate in the case of change.
<br>
### Limits and Offsets


<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resources/Day2_Session2/mate_2.png" alt="IR" width=auto height=auto>

Limits and offsets are set so the model moves as it should in the real world. That is, without clipping through other objects. Offset is the distance from the initial point, angle with respect to the original orientation or the axis of rotation that is modified. Limits are to restrict the motion of a moving object.


### Suppress and Animate features

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resources/Day2_Session2/mate_3.png" alt="IR" width=auto height=auto>

The above list is shown when the mate is right-clicked. Most options are self explanatory. The unique ones are the Suppress and the Animate options. The Suppress option temporarily disables a mate. This is often used to fix any errors in the movement of the individual parts. The Animate option sets the mate into motion.
#### More options regarding Animate


<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/resources/Day2_Session2/mate_4.png" alt="IR" width=auto height=auto>

Steps refers to the number of movements to take to reach from the start value to the end value. There are 3 types of Playback types : Single, Reciprocate and Loop. The icon to the right of the Playback type drop down can be used to choose the direction of rotation.

## Some projects 

### Door Hinge
This project uses only the Fastened, Revolute and the Cylindrical Mates. 

<div>{%- include extensions/youtube.html id='IaQl7qQqt40' -%}</div>

### Solenoid Boxer 4 Engine
This project uses only the Fastened, Revolute and the Slider Mates.

<div>{%- include extensions/youtube.html id='wVV5KKzx3Dw' -%}</div>

## Final Note
It can be seen that using the basic mates and features of OnShape anyone can build models of real life use cases. Simulations of moving objects can be done as well as designing parts. Similar to mates there are also relation such as gear relation and gear and pinion relations which are used for gear mechanics and more complex models.

In the next section, we will be using all the concepts introduced so far to create a CAD model of a bot with a working assembly and mates.
